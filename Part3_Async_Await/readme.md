# Asynchronous Programming Exercises
## Part 3: Async/Await
### Description

This part focuses on implementing async/await to fetch data from the JSONPlaceholder API (e.g., posts endpoint). The async/await implementation displays "Loading..." in the div element while the data is being fetched and updates the text to show the fetched data once it is received. Additionally, error handling is implemented to handle errors such as network issues or timeouts gracefully and display error messages in the div element.

### Files

* `async-await.html`: HTML file with basic structure and styling
* `async_await.css`: CSS file for styling
* `async-await.js`: JavaScript file implementing async/await functionality

### Implementation

1. Create an HTML file named "async-await.html" with the basic structure of an HTML document.
2. Include a button and a div element in the HTML file.
3. Implement JavaScript functionality that uses async/await to fetch data from the JSONPlaceholder API (e.g., posts endpoint).
4. Display "Loading..." in the div element while the data is being fetched.
5. Update the text to show the fetched data once it is received.
6. Implement error handling to handle errors such as network issues or timeouts gracefully and display error messages in the div element.
