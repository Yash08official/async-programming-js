# Asynchronous Programming Exercises

## Part 1: Callbacks
### Description

This part focuses on implementing callbacks to simulate a delay of 5 seconds when a button is clicked. The callback function updates the text in a div element to display "Callback executed after 5 seconds" after the delay. Additionally, the callback implementation is modified to fetch data from the JSONPlaceholder API (e.g., posts endpoint) and display the fetched data (e.g., post titles) in the div element after the callback is executed.

### Files

* `callbacks.html`: HTML file with basic structure and styling
* `callbacks.css`: CSS file for styling
* `callbacks.js`: JavaScript file implementing callback functionality

### Implementation

1. Create an HTML file named "callbacks.html" with the basic structure of an HTML document.
2. Include a button and a div element in the HTML file.
3. Implement JavaScript functionality that utilizes a callback function to simulate a delay of 5 seconds when the button is clicked.
4. Update the text in the div element to display "Callback executed after 5 seconds" after the delay.
5. Modify the callback implementation to fetch data from the JSONPlaceholder API (e.g., posts endpoint).
6. Display the fetched data (e.g., post titles) in the div element after the callback is executed.
