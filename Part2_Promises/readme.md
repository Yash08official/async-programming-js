# Asynchronous Programming Exercises
## Part 2: Promises
### Description

This part focuses on implementing promises to fetch data from the JSONPlaceholder API (e.g., posts endpoint). The promise implementation displays "Loading..." in the div element while the promise is pending and updates the text to show the fetched data once the promise is resolved. Additionally, error handling is implemented to reject the promise with a message like "Operation timed out" if it takes longer than 5 seconds to resolve.

### Files

* `promises.html`: HTML file with basic structure and styling
* `promises.css`: CSS file for styling
* `promises.js`: JavaScript file implementing promise functionality

### Implementation

1. Create an HTML file named "promises.html" with the basic structure of an HTML document.
2. Include a button and a div element in the HTML file.
3. Implement JavaScript functionality that creates a promise to fetch data from the JSONPlaceholder API (e.g., posts endpoint).
4. Display "Loading..." in the div element while the promise is pending.
5. Update the text to show the fetched data once the promise is resolved.
6. Implement error handling to reject the promise with a message like "Operation timed out" if it takes longer than 5 seconds to resolve.
